Clustering Project

How do we better estimate property value with less error?

(predict log error of Zestimate)

This project was built using python

**Goal**
Improve our original estimate of the log error by using clustering methodologies.


**Deliverables**

Report in a jupyter notebook

Clustering algorithm used to/ as:

> a tool to explore features
>
> select/ engineer feature
>
> subset the target variable - log error

Report should contain:

data dictionary

stat 

visualization 

model/ model evaluation

analyses/ takeaway

key driver to log error

Oral presentation of google slides

Multiple .py files with transformations to run model

**Material**

Zillow data

Access to the Codeup Bayes db with mysql > zillow_db

Personal env.py file containing db access info: host, user, & password

**Method**

Pull all .py files

acquire.py

prep.py

split_scale.py

model.py

Add your env.py file

Run through telco_pipeline.ipynb

Random states are set as 123 in the notebook
