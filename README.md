**Clustering Project: How to better estimate property value with less error? (predict log error of Zestimate)**

**Goal**

1. Utilize machine learning to improve the housing value estimation (Zestimate)/ reduce logerror.

2. Build machine learning models to predict logerror

3. Identify the key factor(s) causing the difference(s) between logerror and housing value.

**Deliverables**

- Report (in jupyter notebook)

- Clustering algorithm used to / as:

> a tool to explore features
>
> select / engineer feature
>
> subset the target variable - log error

- Report contains:

  - data dictionary

  - stats 

  - visualizations 

  - models/ model evaluations

  - analyses/ takeaway

  - analysis on key drivers for log error

- Oral presentation of jupyter notebook

  - Multiple .py files to run model and reproduce the report

**Material**

Zillow data

Access to the Codeup Bayes db with mysql > zillow_db

Personal env.py file containing db access info: host, user, & password

**Method**

Pull all .py files

  > acquire.py, prep.py, split_scale.py, model.py

Add your env.py file

Run through Zillow.ipynb

*Random states are set as 123 in the notebook*
